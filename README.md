a logbook made with html css and js that allows adding books with their own details

Things I've Learnt:
1. creating a popup window 
    - using css and js to manipulate opacity of popup div whenever button for enabling or disabling popup is clicked
2. create div elements through js
    - div elements are created based on user interactivity
