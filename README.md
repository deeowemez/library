# library

a logbook made with html css and js that allows adding books with their own details

Things I've Learnt:
1. creating a popup window 
    - using css and js to manipulate opacity of popup div whenever button for enabling or disabling popup is clicked








<!-- Draft:
1. Additions are layed out with cards
2. Ideal Card Layout:

Flow (draft):
1. addEventListener for new book button
2. redirect to addBookToLibrary()
3.
